# Auto Format Code

Please format our code using the project's configured formatter. Remember that we are using maximum code line lengths of 120 characters.

Keep these rules in mind while investigating and updating formatting:
 - avoid unecessary format changes since this creates excess noise in pull results
 - keep the formatting focused and clean
 - stick to standard Python conventions whenever possible unless directly instructed not to do so
 
Proceed with formatting in the following steps:
 1. Check to see what tools are used to perform formatting in this proejct
 2. Specifically check the `pyproject.toml` file for formatting options
 3. Use appropriate tools to assess the state of formatting in this project
 4. Use appropriate auto-formatting tools to update the formatting in this project
 4. Remedy any formatting issues that are found and that were not automatically fixed

If formatting fails or no formatter is found:
- Explain what was tried
- Show available options
- Proceed once I have chosen an option

This ensures consistent code style according to your project's standards.
